\paragraph*{1: By the book}
Book section 2.5, p10, 11; section 4.6, p16.

\paragraph*{2: Definitions}
Let $\hat{x} = 32$ be regarded as an approximation to the positive
solution for $f(x_*) = x_*^2 - 1000 = 0$.  What are the absolute
error, the relative error, and the residual error?

\paragraph*{3: Pi, see!}
The following routine estimates $\pi$ by recursively computing the
semiperimeter of a sequence of $2^{k+1}$-gons embedded in the unit circle:
\lstset{language=matlab,frame=lines,columns=flexible}
\lstinputlisting{ps3pibad.m}
Plot the absolute error $|s_k-\pi|$ against $k$ on a semilog plot.
Explain why the algorithm behaves as it does, and describe a
reformulation of the algorithm that does not suffer from this problem.
