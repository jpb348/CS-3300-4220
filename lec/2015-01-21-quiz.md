Please write your name and NetID on a sheet of paper and
answer the following questions (will not be graded):

0. Why are you taking the class?

1. What is the Taylor series for $1/(1+x)$?

2. What is $\partial r^{-2}/\partial x$ for $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$?

3. What is the solution to this linear system?

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix} x \\  y \end{bmatrix} =
   \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
4. Which matrix is positive definite?

   $$
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
   B = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
   C = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
5. What is the complexity (using order notation) of the following?

        for i = 1:n
          for j = i:n
            v(i) = v(i) + A(i,j)*x(j)

6. Express in words what the previous code does
