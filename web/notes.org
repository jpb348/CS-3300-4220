15 weeks


Name, enrolled, why taking?

Calculus:
- Taylor series for 1/(1+x); error on truncating?
- Partial w.r.t. x of r^-2 where r^2 = x^2 + y^2?

Linear algebra:
- Solve linear system

  [1, 2; 0, 3]*[x; y] = [3; 3]

- Which matrix is pos def?

  [1, 1; 1, 1], [-1, 2; 2, -1], [2, -1; -1, 2]

- When is an upper triangular matrix singular?

Order notation and basic MATLAB:
- Complexity of following using order notation

    for i = 1:n
      for j = i:n
        v(i) = v(i) + A(i,j)*x(j);

- Express in words what the above algorithm does



I want to cover:
- Matrix operations
- Linear systems (dense, sparse, structured)
- Least squares and orthogonal transforms
- Iterative solvers
- Eigenproblems and SVD
