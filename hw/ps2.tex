I recommend that you look at problem 2 early (this is related to the
lecture for Jan 26 and associated notes).  Problems 5-10 are
associated with the reading for Wednesday, Jan 28; I recommend you
look at (though not necessarily attempt) the problems {\em before}
reading the relevant book sections, and ideally before Wednesday's
lecture.  You will find some of the problems are nearly solved -- or
very similar problems are solved -- in the chapter text.

\paragraph*{1: By the book}
Book section 4.6, problems 5--10

\paragraph*{2: Recognizing rank}
Consider the MATLAB fragment

\lstset{language=matlab,frame=lines,columns=flexible}
\begin{lstlisting}
function [y] = ps2mult(x)
  n = length(x);
  A = reshape(1:n^2, n, n);
  y = A*x;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is $A$ for $n = 3$?
\item Show that $A$ has rank two (independent of $n$).
\item Rewrite {\tt ps2mult} so that it runs in $O(n)$ time.
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
